### Hello there!

You can call me Roberto. I am currently enrolled as an academic in the Systems Analysis and Development B. Tech course. I'm also eager to explore different stacks and tools beyond the traditional academia to further improve my knowledge and competence in technology.

- 🔭 **Working**: as a Data Engineering intern at Compass.UOL
- 📚 **Learning**: AWS solutions | Docker | Git/GitHub | Linux | Hadoop | PySpark | Python | SQL

---

- 🌱 I enjoy Minimalism, Autodidacticism, Continuous improvement and constructive criticism.
- 🤔 Sometimes I suffer from analysis paralysis (I'm getting better at managing it)!
- 🎨 I like drawing, painting, playing the guitar and playing *Dungeons & Dragons*.
- 🎹 One day, I would like to learn music theory and how to play the piano.
- 🐈 Cats are my favourite animals. Send me all the memes!

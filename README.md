### Hello there!

You can call me Roberto. I am currently enrolled as an academic in the Systems Analysis and Development B. Tech course. I'm also eager to explore different stacks and tools beyond the traditional academia to further improve my knowledge and competence in technology.

- 📚 **Currently Learning**: Python (and Python engines, frameworks, and integrations - see my [100-days-of-python](https://github.com/RobertoLJr/100-days-of-python) repository for projects)

**Stack**: Apache Spark (PySpark) | AWS solutions | Docker | Git/GitHub | Linux | Hadoop | Python (Flask, NumPy, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, etc) | SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)

---

- 🌱 I enjoy Minimalism, Autodidacticism, Continuous improvement and constructive criticism.
- 🎨 I like drawing, painting, writing, playing the guitar and also *Dungeons & Dragons*.
- 🎹 One day, I would like to learn music theory and how to play the piano.
- 🐈 Cats are my favourite animals. Send me the silliest of the memes.
- 💭 At some point in life, I'll probably start a small farm.
